/* Syntax Highlighting */

/* Syntax highlighting works by using a trasnparent text area that overlays a styling container which 
 * contains the tokenised & styled code. To work, the layers need to be pixel-exact. These rules ensure they are.
 * Bootstraps styling kept messing this up and would override rules, resulting !importants are used here to make
 * sure the rules are followed
